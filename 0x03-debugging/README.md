Debugging is the process of finding and fixing errors in software that prevents it from running correctly. As you become a more advanced programmer and an industry engineer, you will learn how to use debugging tools such as gdb or built-in tools that IDEs have. However, it’s important to understand the concepts and processes of debugging manually.

## General
- What is debugging
- What are some methods of debugging manually
- How to read the error messages
- All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89

## Requirements
**General**
- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89
- All your files should end with a new line
- Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl
- A README.md file at the root of the repo, containing a description of the repository
- A README.md file, at the root of the folder of this project (i.e. 0x03-debugging), describing what this project is about

**Question #0**
This code doesn’t work as intended.

```C
#include "main.h"

/**
* main - prints even numbers from 0 to 100
* Return: 0
*/

int main(void)
{
        int i;

        for (i = 0; i < 100; i++)
        {
                if (i % 2 != 0)
                {
                        continue;
                }
                else
                {
                        break;
                }

                printf("%d\n", i);
        }

        return(0);
}
```
Let’s add printf statements to the code. What information do the printf statements tell us about how our code is executed?

```c
#include "main.h"

/**
* main - prints even numbers from 0 to 100
* Return: 0
*/

int main(void)
{
        int i;

        printf("Before loop\n");

        for (i = 0; i < 100; i++)
        {
                if (i % 2 != 0)
                {
                        printf("i is not even so don't print\n");
                        continue;
                }
                else
                {
                        printf("i is even, break to print\n");
                        break;
                }

                printf("Outside of if/else, still inside for loop\n");

                printf("%d\n", i);
        }

        printf("For loop exited\n");

        return(0);
}
```

- [ ] A printf statement shows exactly how many times the loop executes

- [x] A printf statement shows when the for loop is finished

- [ ] A printf statement shows that there is an infinite loop in the code

- [x] printf statements shows that break will cause “For loop exited” to print, indicating that the even number is never printed

```
- [x] We want to assign j a new value, not compare it, so it should be j = j - 1 instead of j == j - 1

- [ ] We don’t need to assign a new value to j because it doesn’t do anything

- [ ] We want to compare j so we need an if statement before j == j - 1

- [ ] j is always equal to i so the loop will never end


- [x] j never increments so it will always be less than 10

- [x] j never increments so it is always going to print 0

# TASKS
# Task 0. Multiple mains
In most projects, we often give you only one main file to test with. For example, this main file is a test for a postitive_or_negative() function similar to the one you worked with in an earlier C project:
```bash
khalfan@aisha:/debugging$ cat main.c
#include "main.h"

/**
* main - tests function that prints if integer is positive or negative
* Return: 0
*/

int main(void)
{
        int i;

        i = 98;
        positive_or_negative(i);

        return (0);
}
khalfan@aisha:/debugging$
khalfan@aisha:/debugging$ cat main.h
#ifndef MAIN_H
#define MAIN_H

#include <stdio.h>

void positive_or_negative(int i);

#endif /* MAIN_H */
khalfan@aisha:/debugging$ 
khalfan@aisha:/debugging$ gcc -Wall -pedantic -Werror -Wextra -std=gnu89 positive_or_negative.c main.c
khalfan@aisha:/debugging$ ./a.out
98 is positive
khalfan@aisha:/debugging$
```
Based on the main.c file above, create a file named 0-main.c. This file must test that the function positive_or_negative() gives the correct output when given a case of 0.

You are not coding the solution / function, you’re just testing it! However, you can adapt your function from 0x01. C - Variables, if, else, while - Task #0 to compile with this main file to test locally.

You only need to upload 0-main.c and main.h for this task. We will provide our own positive_or_negative() function.
You are not allowed to add or remove lines of code, you may change only one line in this task.
```bash
khalfan@aisha:/debugging$ gcc -Wall -pedantic -Werror -Wextra -std=gnu89 positive_or_negative.c 0-main.c -o 0-main
khalfan@aisha:/debugging$ ./0-main
0 is zero
khalfan@aisha:/debugging$ wc -l 0-main.c
16 1-main.c
khalfan@aisha:/debugging$ 
```

# Task 1. Like, comment, subscribe
Copy this main file. Comment out (don’t delete it!) the part of the code that is causing the output to go into an infinite loop.

Don’t add or remove any lines of code, as we will be checking your line count. You are only allowed to comment out existing code.
You do not have to compile with -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic for this task.
```bash
khalfan@aisha:/debugging$ cat 1-main.c
#include <stdio.h>

/**
* main - causes an infinite loop
* Return: 0
*/

int main(void)
{
        int i;

        printf("Infinite loop incoming :(\n");

        i = 0;

        while (i < 10)
        {
                putchar(i);
        }

        printf("Infinite loop avoided! \\o/\n");

        return (0);
}
khalfan@aisha:/debugging$
```
Your output should look like this:
```bash
khalfan@aisha:/debugging$ gcc -std=gnu89 1-main.c -o 1-main
khalfan@aisha:/debugging$ ./1-main
Infinite loop incoming :(
Infinite loop avoided! \o/

Date: 02/29/2000
Invalid date: 02/29/2000

```
? That doesn’t seem right.

Fix the print_remaining_days() function so that the output works correctly for all dates and all leap years.

- Line count will not be checked for this task.
- You can assume that all test cases have valid months (i.e. the value of month will never be less than 1 or greater than 12) and valid days (i.e. the value of day will never be less than 1 or greater than 31).
- You can assume that all test cases have valid month/day combinations (i.e. there will never be a June 31st or November 31st, etc.), but not all month/day/year combinations are valid (i.e. February 29, 1991 or February 29, 2427).
